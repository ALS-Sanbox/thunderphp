Steps for Testing & Debugging
Set Up the Test Environment

Ensure you have a database table named samples with the required columns: id, name, email, date_created, and date_updated.
Ensure that the database connection configuration is properly set up in your Model class or configuration file.
Verify Routing

Access each route (/index, /create, /edit, /delete) in your browser or using a tool like Postman.
Confirm that the correct controller method is being called for each route.
Test Each Action

Index:
Add sample data to the samples table directly (if no records exist).
Visit /index to ensure all records are displayed in the table.
Create:
Visit /create and submit the form with valid data.
Check the database to confirm a new record has been inserted.
Submit the form with invalid data (e.g., missing name or email) to confirm validation errors are displayed.
Edit:
Access /edit?id=<id> with a valid id and confirm the form is pre-filled with the record's data.
Submit the form with valid updates and verify the changes in the database.
Submit with invalid data to confirm validation errors.
Delete:
Access /delete?id=<id> with a valid id.
Check the database to confirm the record has been deleted.
Error Handling

Test invalid routes (e.g., /unknown) to confirm a 404 Not Found message is displayed.
Test actions with invalid or missing id parameters (e.g., /edit?id=9999 or /delete?id=9999) and confirm appropriate error messages are displayed.
Debugging Issues

Check the PHP error log for any errors or warnings.
Use var_dump or print_r to debug variables and confirm the data passed between the controller, model, and view.
Common Issues and Fixes
Database Errors

If you get a database connection error, confirm the credentials and database settings in your configuration file.
Ensure the samples table exists and has the correct schema.
Validation Not Working

Confirm the validate_insert and validate_update methods are returning false for invalid data.
Check the $errors array in the model to ensure validation errors are being recorded.
Routing Issues

If the routes are not working, ensure the switch statement in your SampleController routing code is correct.
Ensure the web server is properly routing requests to your PHP application.
View Not Rendering

If a view is not rendering, confirm the render method in SampleController is pointing to the correct file path.
Ensure the view files are saved in the views directory.
